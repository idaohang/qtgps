This program utilizes the GPSD daemon to read GPS data from satellites around the receiverâ€™s current location. It is designed to work with a Raspberry Pi unit connected to a GPS dongle but can work on any Linux platform.


To compile and run: You will need both a GPS receiver and the Qt development libraries installed.

1) Install the necessary libraries: 
	"# yum install gpsd gpsd-devel"

2) Kill all previouly running gpsd processes: 
	"# killall gpsd"

3) cd to the program's directory and compile: "# make clean; make".

4) Start the gps receiver: 
	"# gpsd /dev/ttyUSB -F /var/run/gpsd.sock"

5) Check whether device is running by via "ps auxw".

6) The program defaults to GUI mode. Use the -t flag to run the program in terminal mode.


GUI MODE:

1) Click connect to start polling the receiver and displaying data. The window will update automatically.

2) Click disconnect to stop polling.


TERMINAL MODE:

1) The program starts polling the receiver and printing data to the console automatically. Press the 'q' key to exit.
